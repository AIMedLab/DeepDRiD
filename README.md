# Deep-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Image-Dataset-DeepDRiD-
Automated machine learning can facilitate the early diagnosis and timely treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Following the 1st Diabetic Retinopathy: Segmentation and Grading Challenge held with ISBI in 2018, we would like to promote the progress further through 2nd challenge using a new dataset, Deep Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (DeepDRiD). The challenge is subdivided into three tasks as follows:  A. Dual-View Disease Grading: Classification of fundus images according to the severity level of diabetic retinopathy using dual view retinal fundus images. B. Image Quality Estimation: Fundus quality assessment for overall image quality, artifacts, clarity, and field definition. C. Transfer Learning: Explore the generalizability of a Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading system. The robust and generalizable models are expected to be developed to solve clinical issues in reality.
